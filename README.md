# Business-Sales-Insights-Power-BI

For this project, I experimented with Power BI to analyze and visualize various data sources, enabling me to gain valuable insights and identify trends. The project involved connecting to different data sources, such as sales transaction data, customer demographic data, and market trend data, by leveraging Power BI's connectivity capabilities. This allowed me to bring together disparate data sets and create a comprehensive view of the information I needed.
